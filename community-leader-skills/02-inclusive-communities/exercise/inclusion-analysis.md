## Who might be excluded in accessing your community activities in their current form?

Have a think about who might be excluded from your community and why this might be. Some examples might include: people with jobs, people with caring responsibilities such as a child or another family member, wheelchair users, women and non-binary people, mature students. This is far from a complete list, but enough to get you started.

## Handling negative scenarios

### ### What are some of the negative scenarios which might happen while running activities for your community which will make them less inclusive to marginalized groups?


Try and provide at least 4-5 examples

### What steps will you take to avoid these scenarios?

Thinking about how to avoid these scenarios from the beginning is key. For each of the examples above, provide  a brief explanation about how you'll avoid them happening.

## Designing for your community's needs

### Needs facilitated

What needs are you going to make efforts to facilitate? How will you facilitate them?

### Needs not facilitated

What needs won't you be able to facilitate? Why is this?

## Provide a link to your Code of Conduct

Every community should have a clear Code of Conduct. It should be specific about what behavior is encouraged, what is unacceptable, and how you will respond to those who break the rules. It should also be accessible easily online - so please provide a link to it here.

Note: this should be a specific code of conduct for your community, not a generic one.
