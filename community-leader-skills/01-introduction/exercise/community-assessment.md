## Introduction to this exercise

In this exercise you will:
- Introduce the community that you will be working with.
- Identify the shared struggle of community members.
- Start to think about how you can future-proof the community.

For each header in this document, give as much detail as possible about your community. Leave the headers in, and write your content below them. This essay should form a starting point for the activities you'll do as a Campus Expert.

## Introduce yourself

Before we begin - tell us a bit about yourself.

- What's your name?
- Where and what do you study?
- What are your hobbies?
- What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?

## Community Definition

How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

- Is it a computer science club or special interest group?
- Is it a formally recognized community such as a student society, or is it an informal community such as a friendship group?
- Does your community share interests or an environment?
- How long has your community existed?
- How big is your community? Has it always been this size?

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- What are the problems that is or will bring your community members together? They can be anything, but are commonly focussed around working towards better skills, grades or jobs.

## What is the mission of your community?
 - Based on your community's shared struggled, what is your community's mission? Keep this short and snappy.
- Note: this is not your personal mission, but the overarching mission of your community. An example of a mission might be `'Our aim is the equip everyone, regardless of their major, with technical skills to increase their job prospects.'`

## What do members look to get from your community?

### Activities

- What activities could you run for your community?

- How will these further your mission?

### Communication

- How will they keep in touch with each other?
- What online or in-person platforms will you use, and why?
